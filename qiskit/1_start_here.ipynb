    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome Qiskitters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These tutorials aim to explain how to use Qiskit. We assume you have installed Qiskit; if not, please look at [qiskit.org](http://www.qiskit.org) or the install [documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We've collected a core reference set of notebooks in this section outlining the features of Qiskit. We will be keeping them up to date with the latest Qiskit version, currently 0.12. The focus of these notebooks is not on learning quantum computing.  Instead we will focus on how to use Qiskit, and will go into details only when needed. For those interested in learning about quantum computing we recommend the awesome [educational material](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/support) we and the community have put together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Qiskit is made up of four elements: Terra, Aer, Ignis, and Aqua. Each element has its own goal, and together they make the full Qiskit framework. \n",

    "Terra, the ‘earth’ element, is the foundation on which the rest of the software lies. Terra provides a bedrock for composing quantum programs at the level of circuits and pulses, to optimize them for the constraints of a particular device, and to manage the execution of batches of experiments on remote-access devices. Terra defines the interfaces for a desirable end-user experience, as well as the efficient handling of layers of optimization, pulse scheduling and backend communication.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ignis, the ‘fire’ element, is dedicated to fighting noise and errors and to forging a new path. This includes better characterization of errors, improving gates, and computing in the presence of noise. Ignis is meant for those who want to design quantum error correction codes, or who wish to study ways to characterize errors through methods such as tomography and randomized benchmarking, or even to find a better way for using gates by exploring dynamical decoupling and optimal control.
